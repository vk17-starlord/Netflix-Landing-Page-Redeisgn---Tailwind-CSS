# Getting Started with CozyFood

A simple React Js project with Made with Meal DB api - https://www.themealdb.com/api.php .
User can login / signup to website (for now its stored on localstorage but will shift to Firebase Asap !!) . You can view various meals presented to you with categories . Meal DB api has rich filters and detailed information of each and every meal . You can view the recipie , Ingridients , Quantity and even a youtube video of the recipie (Working on it !!). I will keep on adding new features and UI updates to this website as long as i'm enjoying it !
